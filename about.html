            <div><h1 class="aboutmetext">Hello! I am a 15 year old guy from Canada. I am extremely interested in computers and know Python, HTML, CSS, and learning Swift. I also have a big interest in iOS jailbreaking and Linux.</h1></div>
            <div><h1 class="aboutmetext">I love Pink Floyd. They're my favourite artist. My dad and I own multiple CDs, SACDs, and vinyls from them. I have listened to nearly all of their albums, my favourite being Wish You Were Here.</h1></div>
            <div><h1 class="aboutmetext">Also, I love hockey. Not a huge surprise, considering where I'm from. My favourite team is the Montreal Canadiens. I despise the Boston Bruins and the Toronto Maple Leafs. I also really enjoy anything realted to F1/Motorsport. (fuck EVs)<h1></div>
